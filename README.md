## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

- Using flexbox to design nested layouts.

- How to set a custom counter using CSS to override bullet style lists to something different such as a numbered list.

### Continued development

- Need more practice on styling sections or components when list items are involved.
- A better way to write and style line breaks instead of using `<hr>`. Should've used border instead but I was having trouble with how to use it inside flexbox with the other flex items so settled with `<hr>` for now.
- Keep the CSS more structured and organized by relying on inheritance and grouping selectors when possible.
- Learn more about applying position property to elements.
- Still not very comfortable with flex-item properties so it needs more attention in future projects.
